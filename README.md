# AngularJs Boiler-Plate PoC
In this sample project, I used [ng-bp](https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp) as a standard template to build a nodejs web page, consuming data from Parse and deploy by HerokuDeployButtonForGitHub.
AngularJs Boiler-plate includes many best practices of front-end development process as well as Single-Page App by AngularJs such as:
- Automated front-end background tasks by gruntjs like linting, js unit-testing, concatation, minification, etc
- Custom directives based structure
- LESS CSS
- Twitter bootstrap with UI-bootstrap for AngularJs, 
- Awesome fonts
